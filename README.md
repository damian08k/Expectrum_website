# Expertum Website

Expertum Website is a project, which was created for studying.
The main goals of creating that website were to learn more about:

-   Vanilla JS events and methods,
-   workflow between JS and HTML,
-   accessibility,
-   BEM methodology,
-   using SASS in a webite project,
-   git commands and works with branches, merging and committing.

# About website

That website is based on a free website template that is available on the Internet.
I didn't change sections and content, but I added some mine features (e.g., functional "Blog" section).
